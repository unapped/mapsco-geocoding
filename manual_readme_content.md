## Geocoding API

### Convert Between Addresses & Geographic Coordinates

Geocoding is the process of converting a human-readable address into a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates, which are necessary to "plot" the address on a map. Reverse Geocoding is the opposite, i.e. converting a pair of lat/long coordinates into a human-readable address.

This free geocoding API service is provided by Map Maker (My Maps Inc), a web-based Map Making program. In listening to our customers, we recognized that high-volume geocoding is cost prohibitive. For example, Google Maps charges $5 per 1000 geocode requests. If you need to geocode lots of locations, that becomes expensive very quickly.

To solve this problem we created this free geocoding service, which offers generous limits that will suit most users. For those in need of very high-volume geocoding, we offer very affordable geocoding plans(https://geocode.maps.co/plans/).

You can change the base_url to use the vendors comerical offering.</p>

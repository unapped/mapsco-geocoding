<p>Geocoding API</p>
<p>Convert Between Addresses & Geographic Coordinates</p>
<p>Geocoding is the process of converting a human-readable address into a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates, which are necessary to "plot" the address on a map. Reverse Geocoding is the opposite, i.e. converting a pair of lat/long coordinates into a human-readable address.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p>This free geocoding API service is provided by Map Maker (My Maps Inc), a web-based Map Making program. In listening to our customers, we recognized that high-volume geocoding is cost prohibitive. For example, Google Maps charges $5 per 1000 geocode requests. If you need to geocode lots of locations, that becomes expensive very quickly.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p>To solve this problem we created this free geocoding service, which offers generous limits that will suit most users. For those in need of very high-volume geocoding, we offer very affordable geocoding plans (<a href="https://geocode.maps.co/plans/?ref=SplunkSOAR-unapped">https://geocode.maps.co/plans/</a>).</p>
